# SuperConnectr Test by GRONDIN Lucas

## Introduction
Thanks to SuperConnectr for giving me the opportunity to make this test.

### Stack
I used React with TypeScript 
I used the DesignSystem I'm most familiar with from LumApps

### Application 
The application consists of a search section, a list of movies with a button to choose a movie
When I select a movie, it appears on the right of the screen in a Card 

Change the API key to take yours ([API](src/api/index.ts)).

## Comments
Thanks again to SuperConnectr and I hope to get some positive feedback!
